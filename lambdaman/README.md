# Solutions for lambdaman

## Overview

In Lightning Round, we developed TSP solver using simulated annealing. See `lightning_sa/`.

We developed the transpiler from javascript to ICFP Language and use it to solve complex problems. Javascript solution files are stored in `out_js/`.

You can find some other tools to help solving problems.

- In Lightning Round, we used string compression tools. It compresses `URDL` strings to base-94 integers with decoder program written in ICFPC Language. See `scropts/string_compressor.py`.
- We developed the simulator for debugging. See `simulator/`.
- We also developed parameter search programs to find optimal parameters for solutions. See `param_search/`.
